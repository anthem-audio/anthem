  /// does so in a way that is very efficient when the alternative is to observe
  /// a large number of fields (250+).
  ///
  /// Instead of observing every field in every descendant model, it simply
  /// listens for the state change stream that is already filtering up to the
  /// root model item. This state change stream is used for syncing the UI and
  /// engine models, and since it's already there, we get it nearly for free.
  ///
  /// This function should be used in conjunction with [blockObservationBuilder]
  /// to prevent ordinary MobX observables from being observed while building a
  /// given widget tree.
  ///
  /// This is typically less efficient than using MobX like normal, because
  /// Flutter's rebuilds are not free, and so MobX's approach has some runtime
  /// overhead. This overhead is usually less than building large widget trees
  /// often, so it's usually worth it to use MobX to observe individual fields.
  ///
  /// However, when you have a very large number of fields to observe, the
  /// overhead of observing each field becomes much higher than the overhead of
  /// rebuilding an entire widget. As an example, in a naive implementation of
  /// our piano roll using MobX, the piano roll slows down massively when trying
  /// to move around more than a hundred or so notes, and this is directly due
  /// to the overhead of having so many observables. Since we want to redraw the
  /// piano roll when the vast majority of note attributes change, and since our
  /// rebuild is already very efficient, we can afford to observe the entire
  /// notes collection all at once, and it is actually much more efficient to do
  /// so.
  ///
  /// As an example:
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// @override
  /// Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  ///   someModelItem.observeAllChanges();
  ///
  ///   return blockObservationBuilder(
  ///     modelItem: someModelItem,
  ///     builder: () {
  ///       return Text(someModelItem.someObservableValue.toString());
