# Composable Sequences

## Background

Anthem has usability as a core design goal. For this reason, Anthem presents a linear, track-based workflow as the default, and makes it the most discoverable. We want a first-time user to be able to add an audio track and immediately record audio into that track, and when they open the mixer, we want the signal flow to be self-evident.

If you have only used DAWs with this linear workflow style, this may seem obvious; however, at its core Anthem's sequencer is fundamentally non-linear, which makes its default linear workflow unique. If you are instead already used to a pattern-based or similar workflow, you may not immediately see the point in presenting a linear workflow at all.

### Anthem, a multi-workflow DAW

Anthem is multi-workflow, meaning that Anthem is designed to serve a wide range of reasons why someone might reach for a DAW.

For example, if you only ever want to do multi-track audio recording or editing, the current state-of-the-art pattern-based workflow is deeply confusing, at least to a new user. I want to change the volume of the audio I just recorded, but there's nowhere to do that? Or, if I even realize that each audio clip maps to a channel - and this is not at all obvious - maybe I'm now annoyed that I have to turn down each channel, and wonder why I can't turn them down all at once?

Most DAWs have mixers, so if you're used to this workflow you might expect me to intuit the solution here (route each new channel to the same mixer track, then change the mixer track volume); but most DAWs also allow you to record audio into a single track, and add effects directly onto that track. And what if this is my first time picking up a DAW? It's hard to overstate how much complexity a pattern-based DAW requires you to learn before it stops getting in your way.

However, if what you're creating relies on heavy and/or creative use of the sequencer, a strictly linear workflow likely won't be the most productive.
