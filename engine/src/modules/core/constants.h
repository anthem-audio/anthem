// Max audio buffer size
const int MAX_AUDIO_BUFFER_SIZE = 8192;

// The default size for an event buffer, in number of events.
//
// This is the size of each event buffer when it is first allocated. If the
// buffer is filled during processing, it will be reallocated to a larger size.
// This is done via an arena allocator. The space in the arena is allocated
// ahead of time, which allows for dynamic reallocation on the audio thread
// without real-time safety issues.
//
// For context, event buffers are used whenever a node in the processing graph
// needs to send events to another node, or when a node needs to receive events
// from either the sequencer or another node.
