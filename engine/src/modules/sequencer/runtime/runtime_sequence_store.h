  Anthem compiles the project sequence model into lists of events for each
  channel. To be more specific, each pattern and arrangement is compiled into a
  list of events for each channel. When that pattern or arrangement is updated
  and sent to the audio thread, its event lists can be updated as well. The
  entire pattern can be updated, or a specific channel can be surgically
  replaced.

  The goal of this file is to provide a way to:
    1. Store compiled sequences, either patterns or arrangements
    2. Allow these compiled sequences to be replaced, either in full or in part,
       in a real-time safe way

  // This method allows us to have full control over when these are deleted. The
  // flow is as follows:
  //   1. The main thread wants to replace the events for a sequence, so it
  //      first clones the AnthemRuntimeSequenceStore::eventLists map below
  //   2. The main thread specifically wants to replace the item at sequence id
  //      "mySequenceId", so it prepares a new value for that key
  //   3. The main thread grabs the old value at "mySequenceId", and stores it
  //      in AnthemRuntimeSequenceStore::pendingSequenceDeletions for deletion
  //   4. The main thread adds the pointer to the new map to
  //      AnthemRuntimeSequenceStore::mapUpdateQueue
  //   5. The audio thread eventually releases control of the old map, and adds
  //      its pointer to AnthemRuntimeSequenceStore::mapDeletionQueue
  //   6. Periodically, the main thread will check this queue. For each pointer
  //      it finds in the queue, it will delete the pointer, and clean up any
  //      associated entries in
  //      AnthemRuntimeSequenceStore::pendingSequenceDeletions by calling this
  //      method.

//
// In Anthem, the sequence model is complex. To manage the complexity with
// respect to the audio thread, we "compile" sequences into time-sorted lists of
// events for each channel. These lists are much easier to deal with from the
// sequencer's perspective. The runtime component of the sequencer doesn't even
// know about patterns - it just sees these event lists.
//
// We store event lists for each arrangement and for each pattern. When
// something is changed, e.g. some notes are moved around for a given pattern,
// we don't recompile the entire sequence. Instead, we just update the event
// lists for the relevant channel.
