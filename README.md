## Anthem

Anthem is a modern, multi-workflow digital audio workstation (DAW) designed for creating and editing music and other audio content. It is built to be compatible with Windows, macOS and Linux.

Anthem is currently under active development and is missing key features. No production builds exist yet, but we will update here when that changes.

## Contributing

If you're interested in contributing, feel free to open an issue or a discussion thread and I will reply as soon as possible.

There is documentation for developers [here](docs/index.md), which includes an architectural overview and setup instructions. There is also inline documentation which we intend to improve over time.
